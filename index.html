            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>I want to have a career/life that includes constant learning and improvement for myself, but that also
                creates an atmosphere of pleasurable learning and improvement for others. I want to work with and around
                people, and it is important to me that they like me; but it is even more important to me that they feel
                that I have helped them in some way – not necessarily that I do a specific good deed, but more that some
                kindness or thoughtfulness or wisdom of mine has touched them.

            <h2>vission</h2>
            <p>I will live each day as though I had all the power and influence necessary to make it a perfect world.
                Through listening to and serving others, I will learn new ideas and gain different perspectives. I will
                strive to gain mastery over life’s challenges through increasing my circle of influence and
                de-emphasizing those areas of concern over which I have no control.

            <h2>goals</h2>
            <p>I will seek new sources for learning and growth nature, family, literature, new acquaintances. I will
                show love rather than expect love. I choose to focus upon being effective versus efficient. I choose to
                make a difference in this world.
